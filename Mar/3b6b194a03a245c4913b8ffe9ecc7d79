Rain and wind during the much-publicised Durban International Marathon, which incorporated the SA Marathon Championships, did not hamper thrilling finishes on Sunday as Lesotho’s Tebello Ramakongoana (men) and Annie Bothma (women) emerged glorious. There was drama and gutsy performances by the athletes.  At the start, all the elite athletes clearly displayed that they were going for broke from the onset and only wanted to clock good times.

The first woman home was the South Africa’s “rose of hope”, West Province-based Bothma (2:30:31). She was crowned national champ among the women, and Sibeko among the men. In second place in the women’s race was Chaltu Bedo Nagasho (2:30,36) and the third position went to the experienced KwaZulu-Natal-based Jenet Mbhele (2:37,08). The men’s section quickly formed a small leading pack which was led by one of the pacesetters, Mbuleli Mathanga, and a couple of top athletes such as Yego, Ramangoana, Simon Sibeko, Ramakongoana, Tumelo Motlagale, Rirhandzu Rhangani and Reghen Magwayi.  The leading pack stayed together for a while, but around the 24 km mark the purposeful and brave looking Ramakongoana decided to go on a solo effort and unexpectedly took the lead.  He superbly strided along and at one stage he led about 150 metres from the others.

Later in the race, between 10 km and 7 km to go, alone in the front Ramakongoana started to battle, his pace slowed down and kept on looking over his shoulder and checking behind. After passing the historical Durban Golf Club and turning left at the robots to the straight before People’s Park, he motivated himself and managed to hang in strongly to finish the race as winner. The Lesotho international said at the finishing line, running in Durban was exciting, and he enjoyed the race and the support from his coach, friends and sponsors “worked out” well for him. The women’s race winner Bothma displayed nerves of steel from the start, bombed out like a rocket and stayed upfront alone until she won it. Towards the end, the SA athlete was challenged by the Ethiopian athlete and the former Soweto Marathon winner Negashu, but managed to outpace her to claim first position.

I am so grateful and full of gratitude this year. I only started to run in November and after five months of a break. I’m glad I won it, even if I dealt with difficult weather conditions. It was too windy out there and I really battled.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu4');                                                 setInterval(function(){                             googletag.pubads().refresh([slots['google-ad-m-og-mpu4']]);                         }, 30000);                                              });                               googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                 setInterval(function(){                     googletag.pubads().refresh([slots['ct-anchor']]);                 }, 30000);                              });
