The level of political tension in KwaZulu-Natal, as evidenced by the volley of acrimonious statements whizzing back and forth through cyberspace at present, is way too high. The media is being bombarded by aggressive Whatsapps and e-mails which serve only to cast the party or politician on the receiving end of that particular missiveâ€™s malice, in a very bad light. The tone is often vicious and the messages are often defamatory.

As coalitions crumble and municipalities are bombarded by power struggles, there is much at stake in terms of power dynamics in councils. In corrupt councils, these dynamics control who gets the tenders and where the money goes. With the prevailing power play between the EFF, IFP, ANC and DA in KZN, tensions appear to be escalating fast. This is a dangerous state of affairs. The last thing this province needs is another political powder-keg situation where one spark ignites chaos and violence.

This newspaper has commented previously on the tone of communications from political parties in KZN. It has been an ongoing point of concern. Those who head party communications departments must take heed of the language being used across platforms to convey their messages. Instead of fanning and fuelling the fires, politicians need to calm down and act responsibly. There is way too much to lose if they continue in this vein.
