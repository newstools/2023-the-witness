This weekend’s Durban International Marathon, which incorporates the SA Marathon Championships, is not likely to be affected by the more popular Two Oceans in Cape Town next month. There’s a feeling among the road running fraternity that a number of household names from around the country, including from KwaZulu-Natal, won’t be taking part in the eThekwini event and opt for Cape Town instead.
