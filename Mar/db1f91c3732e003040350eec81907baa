But I must strongly point out that other local schools from disadvantaged areas like Ikusasa Elihle High School, Nsikayethu High School, Ndabenhle Primary Schools, Ndaleni High School and Edendale Technical High Schools have regular players and are really making strides in the game. In fact, one the schools from Richmond, Ndaleni, has become so good in chess that at one stage they were represented at the provincial and national level.
