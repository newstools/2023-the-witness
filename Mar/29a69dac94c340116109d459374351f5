The tariffs have a direct impact on the billing of revenue and the financial sustainability of the municipality. It is recommended that the proposed tariff increases be considered and approved by council prior to embarking on the public participation process.READ MORE Salon in Scottsville shopping centre robbed by armed men She said for the city to recover financially the tariffs must be cost-reflective. Section 74(2) of the Municipal Systems Act states that tariffs must reflect the costs reasonably associated with rendering the service. The cost-reflective tariffs for revenue are prepared and decided by each department at the level of the cost centre or business unit responsible for the tariffs. Mayor Mzimkhulu Thebolla said the city had no intention of imposing unreasonable tariffs on the ratepayers.

The DA’s Ross Strachan said they did not support the tariff increases in its current structure. The increases are unaffordable, especially when year in and year out our deteriorated rate base fails to grow due to a lack of political will. The proposed cost-reflective increases will not go down well if we do not have internal systems in place to monitor expenditure on routine plant maintenance, as at the moment it’s done manually and budgeting in this case is inaccurate. If we just managed our own affairs we would not have to embark on these exorbitant increases on top of inflation. Msunduzi Association of Residents, Ratepayers and Civics (Marrc) said they would wait for the processes to start before they can comment and see what steps to take.
