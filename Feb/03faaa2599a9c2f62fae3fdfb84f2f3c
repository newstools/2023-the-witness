The DA’s provincial leader, Francois Rodgers, said Sopas in KZN have become like “watching the same movie all over again”. Every time you watch the movie you think there is going to be something different. But the fact of the matter is that every year we get the same story. “We get the analysis of what the problem is. We get some plans of how we are going to recover, but nothing ever changes.
