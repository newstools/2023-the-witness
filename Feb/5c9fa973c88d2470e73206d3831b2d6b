Local passionate rugby followers of the Varsity Shield are expected to flock in to University of KwaZulu-Natal’s Peter Booysen Stadium in Pietermaritzburg when the local outfit FNB UKZN Impi take on FNB Madibaz from Nelson Mandela Bay on Thursday at 7 pm. The FNB UKZN Impi head coach Jason Oliphant told The Witness on Monday that the game is expected to attract a lot of spectators because it will be their first game at home. Oliphant says his side are likely to surprise a lot of opponents in the new season.  We stand a good chance as we are playing at home in front of our home crowd. We assembled a good quality outfit and there’s a lot of potential in our team.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-d-mpu-incontent');                     });                  This year’s Varsity Shield is expected to be a crowd-puller after applying a lot of “precautions” a few years ago. After no tournament being held in 2020, a bio-bubble in 2021 and limited spectators in 2022, it’s finally time for action in front of full-capacity stadiums.
