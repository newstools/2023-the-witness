KwaZulu-Natal Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube will deliver her State of the Province (Sopa) in Pietermaritzburg on Friday. Dube-Ncube, who will be delivering her maiden Sopa, was elected Premier in August last year following the resignation of now ANC MP, Sihle Zikalala. A former KZN Treasury MEC, Dube-Ncube delivers the Sopa amid growing unemployment, soaring food prices and slow economic growth accompanied by electricity and power outages.
