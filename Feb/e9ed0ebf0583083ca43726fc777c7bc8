One man was declared dead on the scene and the other died a short while later while on the way to hospital. Details of what exactly unfolded and why were still sketchy on Thursday.

The man targeted was shot, as well as an innocent shopkeeper. The suspects then ran out of the shop and have not yet been arrested. Afana Richard, the shopkeeper at the store where the shooting took place, said he saw the shooter leave the store.  “I was in the tavern next door and I saw the shooter run after the shots were fired,” said Richard. The shop owner, Pavlos Abuca, said he was in shock after hearing the news that people were shot. I was meeting someone at Liberty Midlands Mall. I received a phone call telling me what happened at my shop and when I heard the news my legs went weak. I tried to drive as fast as I could to get back to the shop. When I arrived here, I saw the two security guards and a dead body [lying] in the shop.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-d-mpu-incontent');                     });                  He said his shopkeeper was also shot in the store.  They told me that when he was shot, he went into the back of the shop, where he fell down. They took him to a hospital but I don’t know which one. The workers in the store next door said they heard gunshots towards lunchtime and hid out of fear. “I heard gunshots and we saw people running out of the shop and onto the street. The shop was full of students. The students were rushing out of the store,” said a worker, who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety.
