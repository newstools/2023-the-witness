Mncwango said there was ample precedent for such, as seen in the April 2022 floods in eThekwini, and most recently in parts of the City of Johannesburg. He added they believe it was an inhumane act to have our people face such uncontrollable natural disasters, and be stuck with yet another disaster that has been created by government. We call on Eskom to act swiftly in this regard and ensure that they do what is right for the people of Newcastle as they battle through this hard time. “As people battle with the attempts to dry their damaged furniture, clothes and keep rainwater out of their homes, Eskom has not been forgiving to the people of Newcastle by exempting the area from load shedding,” said Mncwango. He said the party was calling on Eskom to act swiftly and ensure they do what is right for the people of Newcastle as they battle through this hard time.

We would also like to extend our gratitude to the Newcastle Community Policing Forum (CPF), Community Crime Prevention Association (CCPA), Silver Spoon, religious organisations, NPOs and NGOs as well as all volunteers who have dedicated their time and resources to aid flood victims,” said Mncwango.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu4');                     });
