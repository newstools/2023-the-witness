Andre de Ruyter’s exit from Eskom is yet another rocky moment that serves to further weaken confidence in the ailing power utility.

Speaking on that public platform about Eskom being a feeding trough and the ANC as plunderers was perhaps both brave and foolish, considering the consequences that could result. It’s a risk that De Ruyter is prepared to take. As has been reported, he quoted an unnamed senior government minister saying “You know, you have to be pragmatic — to pursue the greater good, you have to enable some people to eat a little bit.” Speaking to the same minister about a high-level politician who was involved in corruption, De Ruyter said he was told it was inevitable “that this would come out anyway.” We still don’t know exactly who he was referring to in the interview as being accepting of widespread corruption at Eskom.
