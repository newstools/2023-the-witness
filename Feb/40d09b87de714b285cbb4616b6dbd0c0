Former KwaZulu-Natal Education MEC, Kwazi Mshengu, who recently resigned as an ANC MPL, will remain active within ruling party structures. Mshengu, whose resignation was announced by the ANC provincial leadership this week, told Weekend Witness that he has no intention of revoking his party membership. I will remain active within my ANC branch in Mooi Mpofana (Mooi River). I will also remain a member of the ANC provincial executive committee (PEC). Mshengu, who in the ANC’s provincial elective conference in August failed in his bid to be elected the party’s provincial deputy chairperson, was — along with former human settlement MEC, Jomo Sibiya — recalled from the provincial cabinet by the party’s new leadership shortly after the conference.

However, Mshengu told Weekend Witness that he had put both the conference and his recall behind him. I’m not bitter at all. I have nothing against the current ANC provincial leadership. In any case, I’m part of that leadership. An LLB graduate, Mshengu holds a Master’s degree in law as well as a Honours degree in public policy and developmental studies. Mshengu, who cut his political teeth in the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) where he rose to the position of provincial chairperson, said he resolved to vacate his MPL position to focus on his legal career.  I want to complete my pupillage programme. It has become impractical for me to continue in my role as MPL. I have reached a point where it has become necessary for me to pursue my childhood dream. Considered an influential figure in KZN ANC politics, Mshengu was appointed education MEC following the 2019 general elections. His tenure as education MEC was accompanied by the growth in the KZN matric pass rate — which improved from 76,2% in 2018 to 81,3% in 2022.

When he assumed his responsibilities as the MEC for Education in 2019 he understood that our education system was work in progress which required the people of this province to put their shoulders to the wheel. Without any shadow of doubt, this province has achieved good matric results throughout the intervening years because of his hard work. He ensured the co-operation among various stakeholders behind a common goal of achieving quality education.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu4');                     });
