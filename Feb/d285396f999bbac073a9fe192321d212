They planned to rob them of their cell phones, and Mzimela produced a knife. The man who was with the woman ran away, leaving her behind. “She told Mzimela and Zulu that she did not have a cellphone and they decided to rape her. They took her to a nearby abandoned structure where Mzimela asked her to undress. When she refused, he stabbed her in her stomach and chest area until she removed her clothes, and they both raped her. “Mzimela said that he was afraid she might report them to the police, so he slit her throat. They waited for her to go still before they fled the scene, and they were arrested a few days later.” In court, Ramkisson-Kara said deputy director of public prosecutions, advocate Mbongeni Mthembu, handed in a victim impact statement compiled by the woman’s sister and facilitated by court preparation officer Seneliso Magdeline Sibanda.
