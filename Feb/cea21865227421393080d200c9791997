The KZN Inland Tuskers have taken a full-strength team to Limpopo for their penultimate and crucial fixture in the CSA 4-Day Series, as they continue their hunt for promotion. They missed Malcolm Nofal in their last match of the competition due to a suspension, but the all-rounder is ready to face the Impalas in Polokwane today.

Erlank has scored 342 runs at an average of 57, while Koekemoer has totalled 328 at an average of 65,60.Without a doubt, they will want to boost those leading scores in Limpopo this week and again in their team’s final match in a fortnight to boost their chances of promotion. Coach Grant Morgan’s men are currently placed second in the 4-Day Series standings behind Northern Cape Heat, but can edge the Kimberley outfit out of the promotion race by at least remaining in the top two places until the end of the 4-Day Series next month. “That’s because promotion is based on competitions played last season and this season combined. Even if Northern Cape go on to win the current 4-Day Series, we will still get promoted if we finish second to them in the series,” said Tuskers chief executive Jason Sathiaseelan on Wednesday. It is basically between us and them for promotion, but we have to at least finish second in the four-day series, which closes off the season. He confirmed that Tuskers coach Grant Morgan should be pleased to have all his regulars available to start the match in Polokwane today against the Impalas, who sit second-last in the 4-Day Series standings. After this encounter, Morgan’s men will face the Garden Route Badgers in their final match on March 9-12 at Oudtshoorn’s Recreation Ground.
