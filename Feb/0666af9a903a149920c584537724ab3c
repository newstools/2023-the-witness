The Pietermaritzburg Girls’ High School Music Department were thrilled by the arrival of a violin donated by South African instrument maker, Murray Kuun. The school said that Kuun, a furniture designer and maker for 50 years, had always considered making a violin in his youth but thought it would not be possible. After a visit to Michelangelo’s David in the 1990s, I was inspired and just happened to pass a little violin maker’s shop in the streets of Florence. He spoke no English and my Italian was weak but, between us, we decided I should try. I bought a book and built one over a period of a year. The donated violin is one of the early violins I made. Kuun added that thanks must go to Greg Pentopoulos for the bow and shoulder rest and to Hannes Jacobs for the case.
