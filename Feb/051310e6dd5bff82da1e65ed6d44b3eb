KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, will deliver her State of the Province Address (Sopa) in Pietermaritzburg on Friday. Dube-Ncube, who will be delivering her maiden Sopa, was elected premier in August last year after the resignation of now ANC MP, Sihle Zikalala. A former KZN Treasury MEC, Dube-Ncube delivers the Sopa amid growing unemployment, soaring food prices and slow economic growth accompanied by electricity and power outages.
