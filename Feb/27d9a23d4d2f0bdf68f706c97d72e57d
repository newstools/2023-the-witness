As Msunduzi Municipality suffers a bruising qualified audit opinion, mystery surrounds their “financial expert” who was expected to assist them with their financial crises.  Despite being told that a financial expert exists, no one seems to know who he or she is and no one has reportedly met him or her. The city manager, Lulamile Mapholoba said he was told this “financial expert” was brought in by the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) to play an external oversight role and assist the municipality with its financial woes. The Auditor-General last week dropped the bombshell that the city had regressed to a qualified audit opinion for the 2021/2022 financial year after an unqualified audit opinion the previous financial year.  Poor financial management, poor debt collection practices and significant losses on water and electricity were some of the concerns that were raised by the AG.

He added that the person is a former Msunduzi official although he could not tell which department he previously worked in. “Getting this kind of support should play a critical role in ensuring such bad reports are prevented. We are not saying this person would’ve brought all the solutions but they would’ve brought contributions and alerted accounting officers to any issues. “This has been taken up with Cogta because when a resource is made available to the municipality, it has to be used. We’ve laid a complaint asking what this person is being paid for,” said Mapholoba. He added that the municipality was not benefitting at all from this official.  Mapholoba said their worry was that someone was getting paid in the name of Msunduzi yet the city was not benefitting from the person’s expertise in finance.

We should be able to do our work on our own without having an administrator looking over our shoulders,” said Mapholoba. ACDP councillor Rienus Niemand said it was shocking to hear what Mapholoba said about the city having a financial expert who has never been seen.  “They supposedly gave us a financial expert who was also employed by Msunduzi Municipality, which makes it quite laughable. This raises questions of whether or not this financial expert was doing [his or her] job but we suspect foul play that needs to be answered. We’ve had four administrators but our finances have become worse. It’s like going from one disaster to another. Someone must be held accountable for all this                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu3');                     });                  DA caucus leader, Ross Strachan said they didn’t know anything about a financial expert and questioned who the person was.

Ntombela said since this has been raised by the city manager as a concern, they would look into it. “It’s disturbing that for four years we’ve been under administration but we still get this audit outcome. This also needs to be investigated,” said Ntombela. Spokesperson for Cogta, Senzelwa Mzila said the department is aware of the deployment of a financial expert to Msunduzi.  Mzila said the expert was appointed following all the relevant legislation relating to supply chain management processes, and has over 30 years of experience in local government. “The department will investigate the matter raised by The Witness. It should be known that the department encourages all municipalities to implement measures that will improve audit outcomes,” said Mzila.
