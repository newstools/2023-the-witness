As tensions between the IFP and EFF intensify amid the collapse of the coalition agreement between the two organisations, IFP president, Velenkosini Hlabisa, on Tuesday called on the EFF to produce evidence supporting the red berets’ claim that IFP leaders are plotting to assassinate EFF secretary general, Marshal Dlamini. On Tuesday morning the EFF released a media statement claiming that the party received police intelligence showing that some IFP leaders were plotting to have Dlamini assassinated.

Ordinarily, when you have been briefed by the police you will allow the SAPS to fast track its process and arrest rather than go to the media. We will challenge the EFF to expose those senior leaders unless they are telling lies.  Following the 2021 municipal elections, the EFF entered into a coalition with the IFP in several KwaZulu-Natal hung municipalities. As a result, the IFP – which rewarded the EFF with deputy mayoral positions in some of the hung municipalities- was able to take over control of the councils.

EFF national spokesperson, Sinawo Tambo, on Tuesday declined to reveal details around the Dlamini assassination plot. “At this stage we can’t disclose anything because the intelligence briefing was given to us at a level of confidentiality. But if anything does happen to the secretary-general of the EFF, we know exactly where to look and who are the culprits and what their motives are,” he said.
