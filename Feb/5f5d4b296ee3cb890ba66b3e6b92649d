The state of the nation’s blood stocks is significantly low and the South African National Blood Service (SANBS) has desperately called on South Africans to give blood to help meet the heightened demand. Thandi Mosupye, SANBS’ spokesperson, said they are experiencing a high demand for blood from hospitals across the country. The nation’s blood stocks are strained, necessitating our appeal for increased donations in aid of those who may need transfusions during this period.

To avoid reaching critically low levels, she said SANBS needs South Africans – active donors, lapsed donors and potential donors – to bolster the national blood stocks. SANBS runs blood drives across the country throughout the week.  We commend the donors who remain steadfast in their commitment to saving lives. Right now, we need all the help we can get – from current and potential donors.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu3');                     });                  “Blood group O and B individuals can make the biggest, immediate difference to the situation we face right now. Moreover, we ask South Africans to become regular donors. By donating blood, we can easily maintain safe stock levels throughout the year,” said Mosupye.
