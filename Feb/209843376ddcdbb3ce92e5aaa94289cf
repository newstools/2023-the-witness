Zulu King Misuzulu kaZwelithini, will on Thursday officially open the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature — paving the way for Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube to deliver her State of the Province Address (Sopa) scheduled for Friday. The Zulu king, who was inaugurated last year following the death of his father, King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu in 2021, will address members of the KZN Provincial Legislature in what will be his maiden speech in the provincial legislature.

KZN provincial legislature speaker, Nontembeko Boyce, said the legislature was excited about the king’s coronation as it meant that it would now be able to host him during its events. We are happy to announce that following the coronation of the king in October last year, we will commence with the address by the monarch which will be followed by the State of the Province Address (Sopa).READ MORE 'The Witness' named as the official media partner for Art in the Park About 1 200 guests were expected to attend today’s legislature opening scheduled to take place at Pietermaritzburg’s Oval Cricket Stadium.

We are therefore confident that we will have a highly dignified and cost-effective inaugural address by His Majesty, whom we regard as a source of wisdom on many important issues, from development to social, economic and cultural issues in the province. KZN citizens not able to attend both the opening and the Sopa, Boyce said, will be able to follow the proceedings online.
