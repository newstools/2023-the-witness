The identification of those that were seen in videos that were circulating on social media is something we cannot disclose right now, but we have an idea of who these people might be. AKA was shot dead last Friday outside a popular restaurant on Florida Road in Durban alongside his friend, chef Tebello ‘Tibz’ Motsoane. Minister Bheki Cele said he had been questioned about not visiting the crime scene and said there was no need as everything had been dealt with over the phone.

The next morning, I received a phone call from the family requesting few things to be done. I was on the phone with the family until Sunday when the post-mortem was done and we spoke at length. So why would I go to the crime scene?. AKA’s funeral service is expected to start on Friday afternoon in Sandton, Johannesburg. He will be buried on Saturday in a private provincial funeral.
