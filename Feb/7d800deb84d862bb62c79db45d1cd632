eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda will keep his position in the City’s executive committee. On Friday, the motion to remove him was rejected by a majority of the members of a special council meeting held at the Durban ICC, which was a continuation of the meeting that was adjourned from Thursday, January 26. The motion was tabled by Active Citizens Coalition councillors, Muhammed Ismail and Imitiaz Syed. There were 209 councillors present at the special council meeting. It was reconvened with the purpose of filling the office bearers’ vacancies that exist in the municipal council.

Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) Themba Mvubu said the EFF was not going to be coerced by any other party to vote on a motion that they raised last year. “Last year we protested for Kaunda to be removed. One of the reasons we wanted him out was because there were still many people displaced by the floods who were still in halls.” ALSO READ | KZN Floods: Durban is in a “state of disaster”, says Mayor Kaunda The Democratic Alliance (DA) also supported the motion. ActionSA’s Zwakele Mncwango said he supported the motion. Abantu Batho Congress leader and axed deputy mayor, Philani Mavundla, said the majority who wanted to keep Kaunda should accept that they were keeping a mayor that was letting the city lose R2 billion a year through water losses.
