However, he urged people to be very cautious. Usually when a notorious criminal dies, their friends hijack cars and burn them. It is believed that they do this to honour their friend. We are urging residents, especially those who are driving, to be very cautious and vigilant of their surroundings. They must also avoid driving alone at night. He said he believes that what sparked the circulating messages was the torching of a car in Maqeleni on Tuesday.
