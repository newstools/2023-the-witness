The mayor was speaking on Wednesday at a media briefing on the medium-term budget adjustments and service delivery issues. Businesses currently owe the municipality R770,545 million, while debtors who have 90 days outstanding debt owe R506,421 million, he added.

This debt was about R248 million.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-d-mpu-incontent');                     });                  He added that the municipality understands the impact that Covid-19 had on people’s lives, which may have led to some being unable to pay their debt.
