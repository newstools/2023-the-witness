They drove off in the principal’s car.We are all still traumatised and scared to go back to work. To make matters worse, [pupils] witnessed the robbery.

However, The Witness could not confirm whether the robbery that took place at the school was linked to the burial of a local gang member over the weekend. While KwaZulu-Natal police said they had yet to gather the details around the robbery, Msunduzi ward 19 councillor, Vusi Ngwenya, confirmed the robbery. As we speak, I’m preparing to go to a meeting that has been called at the school following this horrible incident.I can also confirm that both the teachers and pupils are extremely traumatised. They are battling to come to terms with the fact that thugs can invade a school in broad daylight and do what they did.This incident is confirmation that crime in the area has spiraled out of control — local residents now live in fear.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu3');                     });                  The incident at the school comes amid widespread concern about inadequate school security in the province. However, KwaZulu-Natal Education Department spokesperson, Muzi Mahlambi, denied that inadequate security was to blame for the robbery that took place at the school. As long as people have no respect for the law, no respect for their own children attending these schools and no respect for the teachers giving their own children an education, there can never be adequate security.Indeed, I can confirm that there are security personnel and a security fence at the Funulwazi Primary School.But the fact of the matter is that the security can never be enough to deter those determined to break the law.If criminals are able to break into a police station and steal guns, surely, they would find it easier to invade a school.
