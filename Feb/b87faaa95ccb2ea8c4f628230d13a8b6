Today we tend to go with the modern look and forget about vintage,” said Mncwango. Referring to Sopa, he said the premier’s address was not only important to politicians but to KwaZulu-Natal residents. They need to know the purpose of the government whom they voted, in. ACDP KZN leader Sipho Manqele, who was dressed in formal wear said, as a Christian, he does not go with style. We just make sure that we are dressed appropriately and in a dignified manner. He said Sopa was important for MPLs to see if the community would receive any assistance from the provincial government.
