Mkhize was caught red-handed. Lupke said the crimes Mkhize committed were out of greed and not necessity. If he was starving, he would have targeted items of food or a pair of shoes and an item of clothing. He did not steal food or clothes but stole over 10 name brand shoes. If he were motivated out of necessity, he would not have monitored and terrorised the community of Blackridge for two months.He chose to earn his living by dishonest means, taking from innocent victims.The community of Blackridge had been living in terror.
