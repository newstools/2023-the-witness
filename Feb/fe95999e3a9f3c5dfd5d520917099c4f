Traditionally, if an organisation is hosting a sporting event in and around Pietermaritzburg and has a related banner displayed or hanging in front of the City Hall, it means that it has good status and is popular. The Capital City Marathon currently has a huge banner hanging at the historically prominent spot and is attracting a lot of “onlookers” driving along Chief Albert Luthuli Road or passing by the City Hall.
