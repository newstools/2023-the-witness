The principal of one of KwaZulu-Natal’s correctional services schools, Neli Mkhize, said a 100% pass rate wouldn’t have been possible if she had not regarded every inmate as her own child. Mkhize, who is the principal at Usethubeni Youth School in Westville Prison, said each inmate enters the studying programme with many challenges, and it was up to her to become a mother first, before assuming the teacher’s role.

It wasn’t easy getting my Masters but I believe with the right support I will be able to study further,” she said. Gwiji added with the support of her family and teachers, she was set for success.
