Sex workers, making use of hourly accommodation options in Bulwer Street, are believed to be contributing to the spate of crime that is out of control. This is according to Bulwer Street residents, in the Pietermaritzburg CBD, who believe the increase in crime is being aggravated by a bed and breakfast establishment which offers hourly accommodation. Homes and business premises are being burgled on a regular basis and residents are robbed of their possessions, sometimes in broad daylight.

Once an agreement is reached, the sex worker and the client check into the bed and breakfast. When The Witness visited the premises, sex workers were openly plying their trade outside.  A concerned resident, who did not want to be named, said the prime cause for the increase in crime is the establishment of the bed & breakfast that is frequented by sex workers.  We have ongoing problems with sex workers and crime in the area. The hourly bookings at this house in Bulwer Street is the main reason that sex workers use the premises, leading to drugs and crime.

She said she was in no way involved with the business. I decided to let the municipality auction the property and chose estate agents, but the agents and potential buyers [are having difficulty accessing the property]. The owner of the bed & breakfast establishment said he can’t tell which customers are sex workers and which are not. We offer accommodation, at hourly or overnight rates. How are we to distinguish who’s a prostitute and who’s not?

These women used to be down the road. Some of them went to Boom Street and some of them hung around here. “What am I supposed to do about it? People cannot say that they are here because of me; you cannot say an aeroplane is responsible for [transporting] a hijacker.” I cannot go and patrol outside my gate because I have no authority. [The sex workers] don’t just stand outside my house. They stand outside other houses too. I can tell them not to stand by the gate, but I do not have authority outside the gate. If I was not here, they would be standing outside some other B&B or hotel. Ward 33 councillor Suraya Reddy said that she has tried her best to rectify this problem, even resorting to trying to get the army to intervene.  The army was supposed to come and assist and they did come for a few weeks, but then stopped. We are currently at a dead end and are waiting for legal advice to do something. SAPS spokesperson Sergeant Sfiso Gwala confirmed there was a rise in crime in the area, but said crime in the area was not as bad as other areas under the same policing sector. The community is advised to report any criminal activities happening within their areas. [SAPS priority cases] in terms of the reported crime, for deployment and operations purposes, but all areas are covered in terms of policing the Pietermaritzburg policing precinct.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu4');                     });
