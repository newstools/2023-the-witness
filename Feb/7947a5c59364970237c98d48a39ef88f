Piped water started flowing again at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in Umlazi, south of Durban, on Sunday after three weeks without running water due to a major pipe burst. The construction on the 400mm diameter steel pipeline was completed on Sunday after delays caused by the procurement of material and heavy rains.
