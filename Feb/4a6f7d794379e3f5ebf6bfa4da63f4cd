Mzila said the municipalities will gain valuable human capital which they can mentor to boost scarce skills and improve service delivery. Through this multi-award-winning programme, graduates gain valuable on-the-job training. He added the latest intake follows the successful launch of the programme in 2019 where 500 graduates were deployed to municipalities. He said the department has received good reports on the graduatesâ€™ first day in their jobs and look forward to the positive impact that they will make in the municipalities.

She added that a letter of interest was sent to Cogta to provide them with interns through its programme. In consultation with all business units within the municipality, our skills development office identified requisite departments in which the interns will be placed. The interns have been placed across all the business units including service delivery units such as infrastructure, electricity, water, community services, as well as the support services business units such as human resources, finance and town planning.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu4');                     });                  She said, so far, they have received 72 interns.
