In his winning video, Ntuli was seen teaching students the basics of writing Chinese characters, in particular, how to write the Chinese strokes which form the Chinese characters. He chose to demonstrate his teaching abilities on Chinese characters as he believes “they are more than just strokes, but an art.” Ntuli’s video was among the top 59 videos chosen to receive prizes. Ntuli was delighted at the news upon learning his video had been chosen. I am very excited to be named among the international winners. This nomination has motivated me to work even harder in increasing the knowledge in the discipline of teaching Mandarin.
