There’s no way SA has 25 million potholes. That’s according to Sanral, who on Sunday issued a statement rebutting claims circulating in the public domain about South Africa having 25 million potholes.

The national roads agency would like to clarify that the estimate of 25 million potholes was not derived from Sanral but was presented at an event in which it participated.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-d-mpu-incontent');                     });                  Sanral said they have reservations about this figure. Given that South Africa has a paved network of 168000 kilometres, 25 million would equate to 149 potholes for every kilometre, which is improbable and unlikely. We do not dispute that South Africa has a pothole crisis and we remain committed to working with provinces and municipalities to address it. However, we must be realistic about the nature and extent of the problem. We recognise the work done by so many municipalities and provincial departments in fixing potholes on their respective roads.READ MORE Water supply restored at Durban's Prince Mshiyeni Hospital “We are, however, unable to provide reliable statistics as to the exact number of potholes which have been repaired to date and will be requiring more administrative cooperation from the various authorities to actively report their progress so that we can have a more accurate grasp of the progress made across the country,” said the roads agency’s spokesperson Vusi Mona.

We take these seriously. But even so, we must be careful when using statistical data so that we don’t exaggerate the challenges we are facing.
