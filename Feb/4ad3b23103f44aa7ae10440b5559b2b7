Mpophomeni residents were trapped for most of the day on Wednesday in their homes while police officers tried to negotiate with around 200 protesters who blocked the roads with burning tyres and rubble. However, by Wednesday afternoon the crowd was dispersed by police, who monitored the situation.uMngeni mayor, ccouncillor Chris Pappas, said he hoped the situation would now return to normal so that the hard-working people of Mpophomeni, who were inconvenienced, could go to work on Thursday. The protesters were demanding a meeting with officials and politicians after weeks of service delivery failures left Mpophomeni and other areas in uMngeni Municipality without water.

They described the notice as “fake news” and added in a statement, “It is unfortunate that the real water supply challenges, that we are diligently dealing with, are used to masquerade the brutal campaign to disconnect household electricity supply without notification. The insinuation that it’s about water supply challenges is far from the truth, as we are reliably informed that it is actually about electricity disconnections, which uMgungundlovu District Municipality has nothing to do with.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-d-mpu-incontent');                     });                  The district council’s leadership reportedly met with uMngeni ward councillors in wards one, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 and 13 on January 25 to discuss the water supply challenges that are being caused by load shedding and the interventions that were required. When The Witness visited the protest site yesterday morning, the SAPS was out in force, with four vehicles from its public order policing (POP) unit stationed at the crest of the hill above Mpophomeni. They were supported by officers from Howick and Nottingham Road, with further back-up offered by security teams from AET and Magma.

The officers had set up a small blockade, just up the road from the Thurlow entrance to Midmar Dam. Police spokesperson, Sergeant Sifiso Gwala, confirmed that around 200 people had blockaded the entrance to Mpophomeni in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The protest action had a significant impact on business in Howick, with several shops forced to close their doors when staff were unable to travel out of Mpophomeni. Other stores were open, but reported that, in some cases, only 40% of workers had managed to make it into Howick. During a drive around the town, the impact could be clearly seen. The usually bustling taxi rank area was much quieter than normal and a number of stores opted not to open, including the MTN shop and Tekkie Town and the Falls Centre and Legacy Coffee in Dicks Street. Pappas told The Witness that he would not be engaging with the protesters. I don’t engage with people who do things illegally.I am very happy to engage with people in constructive ways; to talk and to be invited to meetings, but when people try and get my attention by blocking roads, then I don’t tend to respond. Meanwhile, residents in Hilton, Merrivale, Merrivale Heights, Burnamwood, the Howick CBD and the Emaromeni section of Mpophomeni were also warned that the protest action would affect waste collection, street sweeping and grass cutting services in their areas. uMngeni said this was because many of the municipal employees were unable to report for work.
