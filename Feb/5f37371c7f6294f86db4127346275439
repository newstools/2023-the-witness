President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday said South Africa would seize “an opportunity” to tackle dirty money after the country had been placed on a watchlist for financial crimes. A global watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), on Friday said it had placed South Africa on its “grey list” for increased monitoring over deficiencies in combating “money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing.” The FATF sets standards for more than 200 countries and jurisdictions on cross-border financial crime, a system intended to encourage national authorities to improve their performance.

The listing is “further indictment on the ANC national government’s failure to deal decisively with financial crime,” John Steenhuisen, the DA’s leader, said on Twitter. The listing is “hardly surprising when our sitting president stashes millions of US dollars in his own couch,” Steenhuisen said, referring to the alleged coverup of a massive theft at Ramaphosa’s ranch.
