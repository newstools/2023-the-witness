Durban baker, Njabulo Sithole (43) has converted space at Maphephethe, near Inanda Dam, into a booming bakery, Bakers Creationz. Sithole said his sweet tooth and a knack for improving his favourite cakes led to his business, which grew from his home kitchen eight years ago. He said, because of his love for cakes, he started making recipes off the back of flour packets and internet recipes in his late 20s.

He started trading from his home with the belief that his business would work out. Bakers Creationz initially supplied local schools with cakes, muffins and cupcakes, paying schoolchildren commission for selling them. Orders started pouring in and I was able to move to a larger kitchen later that year. I started saving the funds I was making to buy equipment from other bakeries which were closing down. He said he ensured the space he converted for his business in Inanda Dam met the relevant enviro-health, food and manufacturing regulations. Sithole said he continued to develop products where there was a market. I would jump off at the main gate and carry my crates all the way to the delivery gate of the wholesaler I supplied, who is still a customer today. The customer list has grown to include Pick n Pay stores in KwaZulu-Natal and the retailer recently started stocking his products in Gauteng.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu3');                     });                  ALSO READ | ‘The Witness’ named as the official media partner for Art in the Park Sithole said he expected the Covid-19 pandemic to affect his business but the supermarkets were busy and production picked up.
