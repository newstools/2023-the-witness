Msunduzi Municipality’s water team acted swiftly to repair a burst pipe that caused a large sinkhole, which obstructed the road, in Pietermaritzburg, on Sunday morning. The hole, filled with water, claimed the tyre of a truck which crashed into the crater on the short slipway, which merges Hyslop and Townbush roads at the Chatterton Circle. The obstruction resulted in Capital City Marathon runners also having to be diverted while running along the race route.
