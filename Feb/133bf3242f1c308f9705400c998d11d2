Her grandmother said she would ask her neighbour to lend her their pick. I asked her [grandmother] to please give me money to buy cigarettes whilst she spoke to her neighbour, and she gave me R10. I went to the shop to buy cigarettes and matches and the deceased followed me to buy airtime and two packets of chips for her mother.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu3');                     });                  Radebe said after they were finished purchasing the goods from the tuck shop, he told Emihle to come with him to use another route back to her house.  This route went alongside the river and some bushes. He then raped her twice. He said the child threatened to tell her grandmother. I got scared that she would report me and decided to kill her. I left her and went back to her grandmother’s house. Her grandmother asked if I saw her and I said I left her on the way back from the shop and did not know where she was.
