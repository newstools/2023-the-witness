The municipality has disconnected these in the past and succeeded. However, without constant monitoring, more keep recurring. With regards to the illegal connections, they need to sort this out as a community. I do know that some were disconnected yesterday. Msunduzi said it is very concerned about the issues of illegal electricity connections, meter bypassing, theft and vandalism in the area, which continue to put a huge strain on the electricity network, resulting in power outages.

These issues persist despite the city’s many efforts aimed to combat and deal with them, such as the meter audit and the removal of illegal connections. Members of the community are urged to desist from illegal connections as they are highly unsafe and they undermine the municipality’s efforts to supply safe, reliable and uninterrupted power supply to the consumers.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu4');                     });
