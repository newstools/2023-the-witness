The third edition of the Capital City Marathon is set to take place on February 26 and is now part of an international age-group series apart from the Comrades Marathon qualifying schedule.  The race was launched in 2020 as a successor to the old Maritzburg City Marathon, but was not staged in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2023 event incorporates a standard marathon of 42,2 km, half-marathon of 21,1 km and a 10 km run, with the start outside the Pietermaritzburg City Hall and finish at the Msunduzi Athletics Stadium on the last Sunday of next month.
