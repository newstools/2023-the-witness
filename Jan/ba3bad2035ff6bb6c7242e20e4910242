Connor Buck and Stephanie Houtman have both confirmed they’ll be back to defend their titles at the Midmar Mile in a fortnight. They claimed their first Midmar titles last year in the respective men’s and women’s races, and are eager to return to the dam for the 50th edition of the event on February 9-12 at Midmar Dam in Howick. After his victory at the famous KwaZulu-Natal race, Buck went on to qualify for the World Championships in Budapest and also secured a top-10 spot at the World Junior Open Water Championships later in the year.

She’s taking it all in her stride, however.  The Pretoria swimmer said: Open water is very unpredictable, anything can happen in the race but I guess having more and more experience does give you a little bit of an advantage.
