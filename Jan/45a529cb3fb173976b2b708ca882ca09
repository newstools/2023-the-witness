The force commander of SAMIM is conducting an investigation surrounding the involvement of its members in this despicable act.READ MORE Hugo Broos picks his Bafana Bafana squad “The SANDF does not condone in any way the acts committed in the video and those who are found guilty of such acts will be brought to book,” read the statement.
