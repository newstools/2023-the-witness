The partnership will consist of media coverage of activities by the Msunduzi Hospice as well as a series of informative articles focusing on different aspects of the organisation.  Oxford-Huggett said it is important that the public is made aware of the history and background of the hospice. Msunduzi Hospice, which celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, has a staff complement of 41.
