This is a vote of confidence in the product that is purified at and supplied from Umgeni Water’s treatment plants. On product quality (wastewater), Umgeni said, of the 11 wastewater treatment works (WWTW) managed by the entity, nine achieved greater than 90% compliance and two achieved more than 80% compliance.

In the report, the “spend performance” for the year was R969 million, of which R611 million (R825 million in 2021) was spent on bulk infrastructure augmentation, expansion, upgrades and rehabilitation projects. Of this, R320 million (33%) went towards projects deemed to be rural development. Overall, 53% of target water infrastructure project milestones were met. Chief financial officer, Thami Mkhwanazi said bulk water sales increased by 2,5% with the majority of the sales coming from the eThekwini Municipality. Mkhwanazi said eThekwini being the biggest driver of their profits, was no surprise as the municipality was their biggest client. Regarding water efficiencies, Umgeni said in the reporting period, water loss was maintained well below the entity’s target level of five percent, at 2,7% recorded for the year (and compared to 2,5% in the previous year).                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu3');                     });                  With the country experiencing stage 5 load shedding, Umgeni said energy was a crucial resource for water and wastewater treatment processes and optimal pumping remained an important part of the business and, it was important for them to find different ways of generating electricity.
