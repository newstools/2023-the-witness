The first rescue of 2023 for Durban snake rescuer Nick Evans was not a snake, but a lizard, which made him sweat a bit. Evans said the metre-long specimen wandered into a garden of a Westville North home recently. “The homeowners acted quickly, locking their dog up immediately. Monitor lizards are frequently killed by dogs. They then called me, and also kept an eye on it, which helps. A perfect example of how to react in such a situation,” he said. In an attempt to avoid being captured, the lizard climbed onto a grass thatched roof of a small house in the garden, and as Evans tried to reach out for it, it made a dash for the pool close by.

Sadly, we lose many to people, on roads and dogs every year. So saving everyone left, is important. “Also, it is not a threat to your family. They don’t attack. They’re capable of defending themselves though, but not in any bone-breaking or lethal way,” said Evans.
