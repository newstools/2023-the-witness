The majority of football teams from 11 regions that were due to compete in the RWL KZN provincial playoffs are bitter after the much-anticipated weekend event which was originally scheduled for Durban from January 6-8 was moved to January 20-22. According to Nomkhosi Zulu, who is a provincial executive officer (PEO) from Safa’s provincial wing KwaZulu-Natal Football Association, all was “planned and finalised” last year for the tournament to take place early in the new year, but the Department of Sports, Art and Culture “indicated” that it was impossible because of a manpower issue.

The Safa uMgungundlovu regional executive officer (REO) Makhetha Mzimela yesterday confirmed that Edendale star-studded outfit Dlala Ntombazane FC were the “one and only” participants from local circles due to take part in the event, but also indicated it was a provincial matter. Dlala Ntombazane FC head coach Ntombifuthi “Muchichwa” Khumalo said it was very frustrating, unfair and bad for the game because it was not happening for the first time. This is just unbelievable that it’s happening again. This is really a mess, time-consuming and uncalled for. I mean all our players did not have a festive season break and we kept them in training all the way.                     googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-m-og-mpu3');                     });                  ALSO READ | Shock and sadness after local soccer coach takes his life DSR director of communications Thabo Mofokeng told The Witness on Wednesday his department always works closely with Safa’s provincial and regional bodies and “dates that are suitable for everyone were chosen” after consulting with all parties involved.
