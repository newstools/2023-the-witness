Gun crime is now way out of control in KwaZulu-Natal. If anyone thought the level of violent crime in the province would recede after Christmas, they have been proved wrong, given the unacceptable number of attacks on people with guns already this year. We are covering multiple stories right now where people going about their daily lives have been the target of armed criminals. Msunduzi worker Noxolo Dimba was gunned down in her Imbali home on Wednesday last week. On the same day, former journalist Phangisile Mtshali and her friend were shot dead in Estcourt. There was the Ashburton murder of Phillip Gill last week which sent ripples of shock through the quiet community.  If top police structures think they can counter this onslaught with new, wet-behind-the-ears recruits, they are wrong.                      googletag.cmd.push(function() {                                         googletag.display('google-ad-d-mpu-incontent');                     });                  We reported on the murder of Sokela Zondi (46) Ndeleshane in Pietermaritzburg, who was shot six times in the head in front of his wife and children on Sunday evening during load shedding.  In Pelham on Wednesday, a couple was held up by armed men who fired shots in broad daylight, shooting their son in the knee.

The people of KwaZulu-Natal are under siege in their homes, on their streets, in their cars and at work by heavily armed gunmen who carry out robberies and assassinations at a terrifying rate.  If top police structures think they can counter this onslaught with new, wet-behind-the-ears recruits, they are wrong.  We need experienced detectives focusing only on gun crime, roadblocks and visible policing on a sustained basis. We need a functioning dog unit. KZN people need arrests and convictions urgently. Our lives may well depend on it.
