The main race will be a standard marathon of 42,2 km, but the event is designed to also have social runners and walkers. The event is about honouring our late father and music legend. We all know that he was an international icon and travelled all over the world. “Besides the 42,2 km and 21,1 km, everybody will be able to take part, old and young, and that’s why there’s also 10 km and two-kilometre races. So it means, if you want to run it as a marathon runner or a social runner or walker, you will be able to do so,” he said. Shabalala said there will be a lot of other activities after the race, such as Isicathamiya music, indlamu, and uMasikhandi music provided by the community. He said that the organisers took a cue from an old event that was started by his late father many years ago on the South Coast.
