A 15-year-old Durban girl has been in a critical condition for a week with a spinal fracture and a torn aorta which led to a haemorrhage after her hair got tangled during a go-kart ride at the Gateway Theatre of Shopping last Wednesday. The teenager, Kristen Govender, was still in ICU at Umhlanga Hospital in Durban and according to her father, Vernon Govender, she was showing improvements. Speaking to The Witness, Govender said doctors had managed to stitch her torn scalp; however, she had no mobility from her waist down and couldn’t move or feel her legs.

Gateway confirmed that an incident took place at the Action Karting establishment at the centre. The mall said due to the sensitive nature of the incident and out of respect for the family they were not going to comment on the details of the incident at this stage.

Members of our team have also met with family members at the Centres Management office. “To note, the centre’s security responded immediately after being made aware of the incident and proceeded to call emergency services. The centre’s Security Supervisor was in attendance at the scene until the ambulance left the Centre.” Gateway said where possible the centre will assist with any information, reports and details needed by the family. Our thoughts are with the family at this very difficult time. The Witness made attempts to get comment from Action Karting, however, the person responsible for media queries was not available for comment.
