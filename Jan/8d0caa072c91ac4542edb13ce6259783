Search and rescue dogs have helped find body parts believed to belong to a seven-year-old boy who went missing recently in the Stanger area. Paul Herbst, Medi Response’s spokesperson, said several days ago, a seven-year-old was reported missing in the Stanger area. He said SAPS attended to the matter and no results were yielded at the time. On Sunday, Herbst said a relative of the missing child allegedly received a SMS containing information on the location of the missing person’s remains.
