Msunduzi municipal manager Lulamile Mapholoba has taken exception to DA councillor Ross Strachan’s accusation that council vehicles were used to deliver food parcels for votes in Ward 28. Mapholoba has placed on record that there is no truth in the statement issued by Strachan in relation to the municipality’s involvement in any distribution of food parcels in Ward 28.  Strachan released a statement accusing the ANC of bribing Ward 28 residents with food parcels, using city vehicles, ahead of the January 18 by-election.

It remains public knowledge that the community in Ward 28 was highly affected by the April and May 2022 floods and families lost their homes and belongings. “The municipality worked tirelessly to ensure that relief programmes were provided, including the provision of temporary and dignified accommodation for the families,” said Mapholoba.

Our teams are on site at Reggie Hadebe Road attending to pothole repairs, the clearing of storm-water drains and catchpits to ensure that the roads are safe for the community. “This is part of service delivery and there is nothing sinister about Ward 28 benefitting from municipal services,” he said.
